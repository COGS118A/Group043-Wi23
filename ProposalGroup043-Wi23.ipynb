    "# Abstract \n",
    "\n",
    "We would like to create a program to predict the gross income in U.S. dollars of movies based on their year, certificate, runtime, genre, rating and total number of votes. The certificate gives the movie rating (i.e. PG-13), the rating represents the total score received by the movies from reviewers on IMDB, and the total number of votes is how many people reviewed the movie total. \n",
    "We will be using a dataset containing all of these variables for every movie on IMDB. We are going to one-hot encode each of the categories. We will use a loss value based on the actual gross income vs. predicted gross income. "

    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "There have been many studies conducted on predicting gross income of movies. However, there are few accurate ones. Most studies produce an accuracy in the 50-60% range. For example, a study conducted on this topic used several algorithms ranging from bag-of-words to multivariable regression, and still they only produced an accuracy of 53% <a name=\"doshi\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#doshinote). We would like to determine if there is any way to increase this accuracy using different algorithms and a different dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using machine learning algorithms to predict gross income of movies has several benefits. Accurate income predictions can help movie studios, producers, and investors make better business decisions. It allows for more informed decisions to be made with regard to budgeting, marketing, and distribution. <a name=\"dhir\"></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#dhirnote). These predictions can also help filmmakers and studios create movies that are more engaging to their audience. ML algorithms can be used to analyze audience preferences based on demographics and other key variables that help inform creative decisions <a name=\"abidi\"></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#abidinote)"

The metric we aim to optimize is the loss of the amount in US dollars of gross box office earnings compared with the predicted values, using IMDB's labeled dataset of movies."

A valid observation must include the aforementioned features: year (integer), certificate, runtime (integer), genre, rating (float value), and votes (integer). These variables are the ones which are able to be one-hot encoded and therefore usable by our program. Most of the values are strings. \n",

    "# Proposed Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to use a few algorithms to approach the solution to this problem, namely multiple linear regression. This can be achieved through the use of sklearn's linear_model.LinearRegression (and its relatives Ridge and LASSO regression). Our problem is clearly geared towards a regression solution as we aim to predict gross earnings from our features, instead of a classification problem in which logistic regression would be preferred. To test our solution, we will run cross-validation on our dataset to generate an estimate of our model's performance. A possible benchmark is simply guessing the mean gross box office earnings."

    "The IMDB dataset is downloaded from the Kaggle website with no personal nor sensitive information included from human participants. All the variables in the dataset are available to public on IMDB website in which we can eliminate the concern for data privacy and misuse of the data. The movie ratings and box office gross are largely influenced by the viewers and fans of particular franchises and movie stars which may be biased, however, since we are using a large dataset with a huge number of ratings, the bias could be neglected or will be evaluated and addressed if the concerns were to arise. Our final product will be available to students of current COGS118A class, future prospective students and potentially to public and we will carefully monitor and identify the unintended use of our project."
